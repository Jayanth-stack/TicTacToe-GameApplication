# Tic-Tac-Toe with Flask

A web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Flask (Python) for the backend and an interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid as X or O, with a persistent score tab tracking wins across games. The game features a clean UI, real-time updates, and server-side game logic.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Clickable 3x3 grid with hover effects and dynamic updates.
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent scores for Player X and Player O across game resets.
- **Game State Management**: Server-side logic for turns, win detection, and draws.
- **Reset Functionality**: Restart the game while preserving scores.
- **Responsive Design**: Simple, clean layout with CSS styling.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- A modern web browser

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <This Repository>
   cd tic_tac_toe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The app will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

4. **Play the Game**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
   - Click cells to make moves, watch the score update, and use the "Reset Game" button to start over.

## File Structure

└── README.md           # This file
```

## How It Works
- **Backend (`app.py`)**: Flask handles routes (`/`, `/move`, `/reset`), manages the game state (board, player, scores), and checks for winners.
- **Frontend (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)**:
  - `index.html`: Renders the game board and score tab using Jinja2.
  - `style.css`: Provides a grid layout, hover effects, and styling.
  - `script.js`: Uses Fetch API to communicate with the backend, updating the UI dynamically.

## Example Gameplay
1. Player X clicks a cell, marking it with "X".
2. Player O takes their turn, marking a cell with "O".
3. The game continues until a player wins (three in a row) or it’s a draw.
4. Scores update automatically; reset to play again.

## Optional Enhancements
- **Persistent Storage**: Replace the in-memory `game_state` with a database (e.g., SQLite).
- **AI Opponent**: Implement a computer player using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Animations**: Add CSS or JavaScript animations (e.g., fade-in for wins).
- **Multiplayer**: Extend to real-time multiplayer using WebSockets (e.g., Flask-SocketIO).

## Troubleshooting
- **Port Conflict**: If `5000` is in use, change the port in `app.py` with `app.run(port=5001)`.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure Flask is installed (`pip show flask`).
